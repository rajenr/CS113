One of the first forms of data compression was through morse code, by encoding more frequent letters through shorter messages, like e being a single dot, allowing the transmission of information over the wire. A later version of data compression arose with the rise of the internet in the 1970â€™s, Huffman encoding, being dynamically generated on input data was very efficient until the invention of the LZ77 algorithm in 1977.
