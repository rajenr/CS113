# CS113-HW11-AVLTree
## HW #11 for CS113 - AVL Tree (w/o removal)

Complete the `AVLTree` class by coding the missing methods for insertion only (only add, not remove, etc.).  Create a driver that insert a collection of more than 20 randomly generated numbers.  Insert the same set of numbers in a binary search tree that is not balanced.  Verify that each tree is correct by performing an in-order traversal.  Also, display the format of each tree that was built and compare their heights.

Make sure you are building the class inheritance diagram in the reading:
`BinaryTree <-- BinarySearchTree <-- BinarySearchTreeWithRotate <-- AVLTree`


> ***NOTE:***
> - Reading the book helps! Ch. 10 has a lot of information and code on AVL trees and the parts required above!
> - Don't forget about the bug in the code, mentioned on the Slack channel!
