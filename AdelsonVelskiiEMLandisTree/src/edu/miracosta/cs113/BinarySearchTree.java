/**
 * BinarySearchTree.java
 * Class containing methods for the Binary Search Tree data structure. Extends Comparable Java interface.
 * This class is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
 * 1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key.
 * 2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 * 3. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
 * 4. There must be no duplicate nodes.
 * The above properties of Binary Search Tree provide an ordering among keys so that the operations like search,
 * minimum, and maximum can be done fast. If there is no ordering, then we may have to compare every key to
 * search a given key.
